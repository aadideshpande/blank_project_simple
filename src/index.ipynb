    "Below is an example of a Jupyter Notebook that implements a simple moving average crossover trading strategy on Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock data. In this strategy, we use a short-term and a long-term simple moving average (SMA):\n",

    "    Buy Signal: When the short-term SMA crosses above the long-term SMA.\n",
    "    Sell Signal: When the short-term SMA crosses below the long-term SMA.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will download historical data using the free yfinance package, calculate the SMAs, generate buy/sell signals, and then simulate a very simple backtest comparing the strategyâ€™s performance to simply holding the asset\n",
